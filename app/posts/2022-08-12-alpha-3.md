## Content

We changed 'common issues' wording changed from ‘support’  to ‘advice’ as common topics will just be national level advice (from which you can go on to search for actual local support). And they are more topics than issues.

We removed age categories for now - we made it so users will search by issue instead (which could also include ages or stages eg ‘babies’, ‘teenagers’, pregnancy’ as well as  ‘weaning’, potty training’ etc.) UR found people were a bit confused by age categories and what would go in what age bracket - it seems more fluid not defining by age. Added these (age / stage / issue searches) as ‘popular searches’ too. Tried to group common issues (now called topics as not all are issues) into 6 big categories which could have sub categories.

Users felt teens/young adults should have their own route, so some users will be young adults. Made this a common topic, and they could now search for ‘teenagers’ in the keyword box.

We added ‘bad journey’ wording.

The cards for services and FHs were just basic trial wording - we hadn’t really discussed in depth or researched yet about what users would expect to see here.

The common topic is now on sleep as this is a nearly universal parenting issue. Minimal wording here taken from the NHS website - couldn't see us having expressly written content on every type of issue (due to duplication issues and the time/expertise it would take) so assuming it would be taken from NHS or other trusted sites.
