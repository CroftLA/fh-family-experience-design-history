## MVP journey 2 for testing

### MVP versions 1 and 2

We decided to build and test a prototype (MVP journey 2) in which the search for family hubs and services/groups is integrated into one single search and set of results, with the search starting on the homepage. 

This is in contrast to journey 1, in which users are offered 2 separate search routes and sets of results, one for family hubs and another for services/groups, with search pages following on from the homepage.

The reasoning behind journey 2 is that users don't need to differentiate between family hubs and services as separate journeys, and separating them causes confusion. Users simply want support.

### How we have designed MVP journey 2: the homepage

A key part was rewriting the homepage content. 

User research from testing journey 1 had found that users weren't clear about what a family hub is and why they would search for one as opposed to the other. So we tried to explain more clearly what family hubs offer as well as services/groups. For example, we have explained family hubs as a way for people to 'drop in, meet other families and find out what's available in your area'.

Arguably though, users may not care or need to know about the difference between family hubs and services, so we may well find we don't need to explain the difference at the start of the user journey. The challenge will be balancing this with needing to explain what a family hub is somewhere, so users understand the term. After all, this is a 'family hubs' service.

Who is eligible for the service and examples of what you can find through the service were moved below the search box. In future we may need to move them back up, because these are important - and we may put some of the information explaining hubs, services and groups further down, elswehere or remove it. 

We created a new name and H2 heading for the service: 'Find local family support'. It seems better not to mention family hubs before the user knows what they are. Our assumption is that 'Find local family support' explains what the service actually offers better.

Caveats were placed at the bottom of the homepage, with wording blended to cover both family hubs and services/groups.

### Changes to categories architecture

We added a new category option: 'See everything available in my area'. This was so that a user who doesn't have a particular service or group in mind can still search and see a wide range of results.

This category option, if selected, leads directly to the results page (as the user has no need for a sub category option).

### Results page

The results combine family hubs and services/groups. The nearest family hub to the user's postcode is displayed at the top in a blue box, and the nearest services/groups are listed below, organised by distance.

We added some brief text at the top of the results page to remind users what a family hub is and what services/groups are, and to explain that they will see their nearest family hub at the top, followed by services/groups. We aren't sure if users will need or read this or if it is right to display this information here.

We added a link to the blue family hub box for the user to click on if they want to see more family hubs in their area. This leads to a list of their nearest family hubs, closest first.

The user has the option to choose (via radio buttons) if they want to see family hubs only, services and groups only, or both. But because we have added the option to see family hubs via the blue box, we think we can remove the radio button option to see family hubs only, in the next iteration. We can probably also remove the option to see services/groups only, because we are only displaying one family hub at the top of the page, so a results page without that would not be very different.

### Bad journey page

We added a bad journey page to show what would happen if the user didn't see any family hubs or services in their area.

### New journeys

We created several new journeys to test with users, so we now have listings pages for results on:

* toilet training
* teenage health and wellbeing
* see everything in my area
* infant feeding
