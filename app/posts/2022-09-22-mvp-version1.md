## MVP version 1 for testing

### MVP versions 1 and 2

One big design question for the team right now is: should searches for family hubs and services/groups be separated? Do users see a difference between these and do they care about the difference? 

For the last few weeks we have focused on a coded prototype (MVP version 1), in which users can choose on the homepage between searching for a family hub and searching for services and groups.

We plan next to build and test a prototype (MVP version 2) in which the search for family hubs and services/groups are integrated into one single search.

We will test both versions and see what users prefer.

### How we have designed MVP 1

We have redrafted content from Alpha throughout, including the homepage, search pages, results pages and bad journeys. 

The main challenge from a content perspective has been how to make the separation of family hubs and services/groups make sense to users. 

We have tried to strike a balance. We don't distract users with a policy-driven focus on family hubs, but we give some basic information to distinguish what family hubs offer (a 'welcoming place to go', a 'good place to start'), versus a search for services and groups ('if you're looking for a specific type of support'). 

We hope this will help users pick one search or the other and be able to find the information they need. We will see how this goes in user testing soon.

### Other updates we have made

We have:

* added temporary placeholder categories based on user research and desk research in Alpha
*	added blank postcode and category error messages
*	decided to use the term ‘infant feeding’ not ‘breastfeeding’ - policy use 'infant feeding' and it seems more inclusive, but we will see what users say in testing
* decided not to flag up childcare - which is not part of the family hubs service - for now (it wasn’t a big issue for users in Alpha - we will test without it initially)
* decided to test a caveat on the homepage: ‘As this service is new, not all local authority services will be listed’
* made the 'bad journey' pages more consistent
