## Content

Find services overview page - we rewrote text here to focus on services and not mention family hubs. In response to user research feedback that the text on this page was too much about family hubs, which misled users who want to search for services not hubs.

Sleep advice page - we changed the 'Find local support with your child’s sleep' link at the bottom to 'Search for local support'. In response to user research finding we need to reduce expectation here as the link takes users back to a generic search page and we don’t want them to be jolted by that.

Homepage - we added new text under the bullet list: 'Choose an option below to find out more'. In response to user research feedback that some users weren’t sure if they could click on the bullet points and find more info - we are trying to make it clear how they can find out more.

What is a family hub page - under 'Where are family hubs?'  - we changed libraries to community centres. In response to user feedback from a user who was confused because he attends what is essentially a children’s centre/family hub but it’s called a community centre and it’s in a community centre building - this is potentially a key word, more so than libraries.
