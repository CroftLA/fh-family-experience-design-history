## Content

Caring for your child: sleep, food, health and more - we made this list shorter (to include services only) and added ‘vaccinations and immunisations’ - based on desk research of what a FH might offer this age group.

We removed mentions of ‘support’ as a noun, eg ‘family hubs offer support’, as team members felt it was vague and unclear.

We changed content to focus on Salford, not Devon - due to doing user research with Salford LAs.

We redrafted content about family hubs to make it clearer, including info about what ages family hubs support as well as examples of services, and locations. We decided not to test text that would pre-warn users not all services will be available to all (eg they may have to get professional referrals for some) - team felt this was not needed, at least not yet.

We developed the bad journey wording further and added links on key pages to other key pages.
