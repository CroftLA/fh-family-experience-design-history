## Content

For this version, we made the content less about ‘family hubs’ - with no explanation of what a ‘family hub’ is - to test our assumption that users don’t care so much about ‘family hubs’ as about what services they can get near them. Also to reflect the fact that not all areas have ‘family hubs’ yet.

Common issues - we made the previous bulleted list of services / ages into clickable boxes, based on user research findings.

We made the example page about Devon - a whole LA, not a specific family hub - so people can see all services near to them, not limited by one family hub.
